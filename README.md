# Witcher-3-Next-Gen-Changelog
Changelog of the Witcher 3 Next -Gen patch

THANK YOU!
We almost finish the changelog for the 1.32 vs 4.00 (Hotfix 2 included).
We probably won't do for all of them again for the version 4.01 and beyond, but will be in touch for the Scripts, XML, CSV and W3strings.
The last job for us is the XBM changed list.

# Description
Hello Witcher 3 community.
The Next-Gen patche is finally available since 14th December 2022. As we were expecting, CDPR changed much more content but we don't know exactly which files or how they change it.

That's what this changelog does. With the contribution of many modders, we are preparing to find all the difference between 1.32 and Next-Gen. So this useful information will help everyone to update their mods for the free update Next Gen Patch.
The changelog is divided into:
Scripts
XML
CSV
CR2W
CR2W Non Text
Texture
W3Strings
RTTI

The purpose of this project is to preserve the mod library of the Witcher 3 as much as possible. We don't want to waste all the work they did and so the changelog will help to update their mods for the current Next-Gen version.
