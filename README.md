# Description
The Witcher 3 Next-Gen patche finally coming for 14th December 2022. As we were expecting, CDPR changed much more content but we don't know exactly which files or how they change it.

That's what this changelog does. With the contribution of many modders and developpers, we are preparing to find all the difference between the version 1.32 and Next-Gen and write on a sheet files. So this useful information will help everyone to update their mods for the free update Next Gen Patch.
The file is divided into:
Scripts
XML
CR2W
CR2W Non Text
Texture
Bin
W2String

The purpose of this project is to preserve the mod library of the Witcher 3 as much as possible. We don't want to waste all the work they did and so the changelog will help to update their mods for the current Next-Gen version.
