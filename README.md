# Witcher-3-Next-Gen-Changelog
Changelog of the Witcher 3 Next -Gen patch

# Description
HHello Witcher 3 community.
The Next-Gen version is finally available since 14th December 2022. As we were expecting, CDPR changed much more content but we don't know exactly which files or how they change it.

That's what this changelog does. With the contribution of many modders, we were prepared to find all the difference between Classic 1.32 and Next-Gen version. So this useful information will help everyone to update their mods for the free update Next Gen Patch.

The changelog is divided into:
Scripts
XML
CSV
CR2W
CR2W Non Text
Texture
W3Strings
RTTI

The purpose of this project is to preserve the mod library of the Witcher 3 as much as possible. We don't want to waste all the work they did and so the changelog will help to update their mods for the current Next-Gen version.
